# Genetic_transcripton_factor_classificiation
Apply Partitioned Local Depth (PALD) and Louvain Algorithm in machine learning to classify genetic transcription factors in Arabidopsis thaliana.

The data consists of measurements of transcription factors of Arabidopsis thaliana after it has been perturbed by the hormone ACC. This hormone is known to affect seeds by causing them to grow roots in the germination process earlier. Some of the transcription factors are thought to directly influence root growth while others have unknown function. The goal is to use Machine Learning to infer the functions of the transcription factors that are currently unknown. 

Overall, the project aims to understand the hormone signaling networks that control root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana.
